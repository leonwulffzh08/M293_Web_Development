            <p>Yamaha's sports bikes stand for maximum performance, precise handling and racing feeling at the highest level. The models are aerodynamically designed, have powerful engines and state-of-the-art riding assistance systems - ideal for ambitious riders.

              The R-series is particularly well-known, for example with the YZF-R125, YZF-R7 or the flagship YZF-R1, which are visually and technically strongly orientated towards the machines from MotoGP.
              
              These motorbikes are built for speed, tight bends and an intense experience on the road or race track.
              
              Anyone looking for adrenalin, technology and sporty design in one bike is guaranteed to find what they are looking for with Yamaha's sports bikes.</p>

            <p>Yamaha naked bikes combine purist design with impressive performance. Without panelling and with visible technology, they stand for a raw, authentic riding style where the focus is entirely on the riding experience.

                Yamaha's MT series - including models such as the MT-07 or MT-09 - is particularly popular and is known for its powerful torque, agility in city traffic and sporty dynamics.
                
                Thanks to their low weight and upright riding position, naked bikes offer a direct, unadulterated riding experience and are suitable for both everyday use and extended tours.
                
                Anyone looking for a motorbike that combines performance, style and suitability for everyday use will find Yamaha's naked bikes a convincing choice.</p>

              <p>Yamaha supermotos combine the lightness and manoeuvrability of enduro bikes with the dynamics and grip of road-going sports motorbikes. They are made for tight bends, spontaneous manoeuvres and maximum riding pleasure on asphalt.

                Models such as the Yamaha WR125X or older cult bikes such as the XT series stand for agile handling, robust technology and a minimalist, sporty design.
                
                Thanks to their low weight, high seating position and powerful pulling power in the lower rev range, supermotos are particularly suitable for riding fun in urban areas - but also for controlled drifts on remote routes.
                
                Anyone looking for a motorbike that is fun to ride and conveys a real supermoto feeling should take a look at Yamaha's selection.</p>
